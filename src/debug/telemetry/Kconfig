config SOF_TELEMETRY
	bool "enable telemetry"
	default n
	help
	  Enables telemetry. Enables performance measurements and debug utilities
	  that use memory window 2 (debug window) as interface. Measurements include
	  systick_info measurement which measures scheduler task performance and may
	  slightly affect overall performance.

config SOF_TELEMETRY_PERFORMANCE_MEASUREMENTS
	bool "enable performance measurements"
	default n
	help
	  Enables performance measurements. Each created component can have its
	  performance checked by measuring execution time of copy function. Performance
	  records are stored in the limited number of slots in Memory Window 3, so only a
	  certain number (PERFORMANCE_DATA_ENTRIES_COUNT) of components can be measured.
